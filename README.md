# FUTURE_DS_01
AI Developer Productivity Dashboard

Overview

This project explores how AI usage, coding hours, caffeine intake, sleep, and distractions affect developer productivity and success.
It combines data analysis and data visualization to uncover trends that influence software development outcomes.


Objectives

Analyze developer habits and performance metrics
Visualize relationships between productivity factors
Understand how AI assistance impacts success rates
Build a clean and interactive Power BI Dashboard



Dataset

Rows: 500
Columns: 9


Features include:

hours_coding – total hours spent coding
coffee_intake_mg – caffeine consumption
sleep_hours – daily sleep duration
ai_usage_hours – time spent using AI tools
task_success – 1 (success) or 0 (fail)




Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard creation & insights
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – Data cleaning & analysis
Excel/CSV – Data source



Key Visuals

Bar Chart: Coding Hours vs Task Success
Scatter Plot: AI Usage vs Success
Line Chart: Sleep vs Cognitive Load
Pie Chart: Overall Task Success Distribution
KPIs: Average Coding Hours, AI Usage, Sleep, Success Rate


Insights

Developers using AI tools for longer hours tend to have a higher success rate.
Better sleep is linked to lower cognitive load.
Excessive caffeine intake slightly correlates with more bugs.
